# Weather App 🌦️

This is a simple weather app created to learn JavaScript and explore web development basics. The app provides a user-friendly interface to fetch and display weather data from a free weather API.

## Features
- 🌍 Search for current weather by city name.
- 📋 Displays temperature, weather conditions, and location information.
- 🖥️ Responsive design for desktop and mobile browsers.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Markup for structuring the app.
- **CSS**: Styling for an appealing interface.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for API interaction and DOM manipulation.
- **Weather API**: Retrieves real-time weather data.

## How It Works
1. Enter the name of a city in the search bar.
2. The app sends a request to the weather API.
3. Displays the current weather information in a neat and clean layout.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-app.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your favorite browser.

## Future Improvements
- Add a forecast feature.
- Implement geolocation to auto-detect the user's location.
- Enhance UI/UX with animations and modern design trends.
